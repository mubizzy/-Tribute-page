                            Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali.
                            The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. 
                            Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs' non-biological parents. 
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>1972:Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in Portland, Ore.
                            , only to drop out a semester later. 
                            Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested him,
                            such as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.
                        </li>
                        <li>1974:Begins a brief stint as an engineer
                            at Atari. Working the night shift, 
                            he employs Wozniak to help whittle down the
                            hardware required for a prototype of a 
                            single-player version of Pong, the game that
                            would go on to become Breakout.
                            Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to California to live in a

                            September 12, 1985:
                            CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple chairman, 
                            saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, 
                            and it's time for me to get on with my life. 
                            It's obvious that I've got to do something. 
                            I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter,
                            Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling
                            $70 million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT work
                            station, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, 
                            is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server of the World Wide Web.
